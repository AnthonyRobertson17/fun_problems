This is a typing test with the new keyboard and no mouse mat, I have to say that since I now do not have the mouse mat, I really do
not notice that much of a difference since my arms are never really on the table
however I am still making quite a few mistakes on this keyboard
I think that one of the things that I sill have to get used to with this
keyboard is the fact that I have to press down so much harder on the keys compared
to my keyboard at work. I mean those switches in my work keyboard are just so easy to press
which isn't a bad thing, it just makes it difficult to transition back to this at the end of the day
since once I get home and start typing on This


Man I am starting to wonder if I would have rather prefered the MX Browns over
these blues especially considering how hard I am finding they are to press down at times
I mean overall it is a great typing experience (holy shit I just messed that up a lot and now
I am messing this up just as much) but I am looking forward to when I can simply buy a second one of these keyboards so that no
matter where I am, I can always be using the best keyboard in the world
I mean the other thing is that I hope wherever I end up working that they don't find this typing to be too annoying since
I have bought into these switches quite a bit now
Ok so I am now going to take a typing test to see after this much warm up what my WPM is, however I would be surprised if it's
over 50
